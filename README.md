# gitwatch

[![Gitwatch QA](https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch/actions/workflows/gitwatch.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch/actions/workflows/gitwatch.yaml)
[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/gitwatch/gitwatch)](https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch/releases/latest)
[![Docker Image](https://img.shields.io/badge/ghcr.io-gitwatch%2Fgitwatch-blue)](https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch/pkgs/container/gitwatch)

A Bash script to watch a file or folder and commit changes to a Git repository

## What to use it for?

That's really up to you, but here are some examples:

- **config files**: some programs auto-write their config files, without waiting
  for you to click an 'Apply' button; or even if there is such a button, most
  programs offer you no way of going back to an earlier version of your
  settings. If you commit your config file(s) to a Git repository, you can track
  changes and go back to older versions. This script makes it convenient, to
  have all changes recorded automatically.
- **document files**: if you use an editor that does not have built-in Git
  support (or maybe if you don't like the Git support it has), you can use
  gitwatch to automatically commit your files when you save them, or combine it
  with the editor's auto-save feature to fully automatically and regularly track
  your changes
- _more stuff!_ If you have any other uses, or can think of ones, please let us
  know, and we can add them to this list!

## Installation

`gitwatch` can be installed in various ways.

### macOS (via Homebrew)

While `gitwatch` is not yet in the official Homebrew repository, the easiest way
to run it on macOS is to first install its dependencies using Homebrew, and then
install the script.

```shell
# 1. Install required dependencies
brew install fswatch flock coreutils proctools

# 2. Install gitwatch
# (Use the "From Source" or "Releases" method above)
[sudo] make install

```

### Windows 11 (via WSL Installer)

`gitwatch` is fully supported on Windows 11 through the Windows Subsystem for
Linux (WSL). A `.exe` installer is provided to make setup seamless.

1. **Download** the latest `gitwatch-setup.exe` from the
   [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch/releases/latest).
2. **Run** the installer. It will automatically:
   - Request Administrator privileges.
   - Check for and install WSL if it's not already present (this may take a few
     minutes).
   - **Attempt to auto-detect your WSL distribution** (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora,
     Alpine) and install required Linux dependencies (`git`, `coreutils`,
     `util-linux`, `inotify-tools`) using the correct package manager.
   - Install the `gitwatch.sh` script into WSL.
   - Install a `gitwatch.bat` wrapper on your Windows system and add it to your
     `PATH`.

**Note:** The installer works best with major distributions. If you use a custom
or unrecognized WSL distribution, you may be prompted to install the
dependencies manually.

After installation, you can open any Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell
terminal and use `gitwatch` as if it were a native application:

```shell
# Example: Watch a directory in your Windows "Documents" folder
gitwatch -r origin -b main "C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\MyNotes"
```

The wrapper automatically handles path translation, and `gitwatch` will use your
existing Windows `.gitconfig` and SSH keys.

### From Source

`gitwatch` can be installed from source using the provided `Makefile`. This is
the recommended method for building from source as it uses standard `install`
commands.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch.git
cd gitwatch
[sudo] make install
```

This will install `gitwatch.sh` to `/usr/local/bin/gitwatch` by default. You can
uninstall it at any time with `[sudo] make uninstall`.

### Releases

For the most stable version, you can download the `gitwatch.sh` script directly
from the project's
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch/releases/latest).

This is a simple way to get the latest tagged script without cloning the entire
repository. A common way to install it is to download it directly into your
local bin path:

```sh
# Download the latest version to /usr/local/bin (you may need sudo)
curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/gitwatch [https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch/releases/latest/download/gitwatch.sh](https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch/releases/latest/download/gitwatch.sh)

# Make it executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gitwatch
```

#### Update

If you installed `gitwatch` from source, you can update it by following the
exact same steps (or `git pull` rather than clone if you kept the repository
around).

### bpkg

`gitwatch` can be installed with [bpkg](https://github.com/bpkg/bpkg). Make sure
you have [bpkg](https://github.com/bpkg/bpkg) installed before running the
command below. You may need to invoke `bpkg` with `sudo` when using the `-g`
flag.

```sh
[sudo] bpkg install -g gitwatch/gitwatch
```

### Archlinux

There is an [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gitwatch-git/) package for
Archlinux. Install it with you favorite aur helper.

### NixOS

Starting from NixOS 24.11 this package available in mainline. Additionally, you
can use receipts from this repository.

#### As Module

Each watching path should be described in _submodule_ `services.gitwatch.*` like
next:

```nix
services.gitwatch.<service name> = {
    enable = true;
    path = "/home/me/my-repo";
    remote = "git@github.com:me/my-repo.git";
    user = "me";
    message = "Auto-commit by gitwatch on %d";
};
```

This will make NixOS to create `systemd` service named
`gitwatch-<service name>`. More details you can see at `man configuration.nix`.

#### As Package

The `gitwatch` script available as package in _nixpkgs_;

## Docker

You can also run `gitwatch` inside a Docker container. This is useful for
isolating dependencies and ensuring a consistent environment.

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

The easiest way to run `gitwatch` with Docker is by using the provided
[`docker-compose.yaml`](./docker-compose.yaml) file. This file is configured
using environment variables.

**1. Prerequisites:**

- **Docker and Docker Compose**: Make sure you have both installed.
- **A Git Repository**: You need a local directory that is a Git repository you
  want to watch.
- **SSH Key**: For pushing to a remote repository, the container needs access to
  an SSH key that is authorized with your Git provider.

**2. Configuration:**

You must configure the `docker-compose.yaml` file before running it, primarily
the `volumes` and `environment` sections.

**Warning:** To avoid file permission errors when mounting a local directory
(volume), you **must** set the `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables in the
`docker-compose.yaml` file to match your host user's ID. You can find these on
your host machine by running `id -u` (for PUID) and `id -g` (for PGID). Please
review the comments within the [`docker-compose.yaml`](./docker-compose.yaml)
file for detailed instructions on setting volumes and environment variables.

**3. Environment Variables:**

The following environment variables are available for configuring the `gitwatch`
container:

| Variable               | Default Value          | Description                                                                                                                             |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PUID`                 | `1000`                 | **Required.** Sets the User ID (UID) for the container's non-root user to match the host user, preventing file permission issues.       |
| `PGID`                 | `1000`                 | **Required.** Sets the Group ID (GID) for the container's user. Run `id -g` on your host to find this value.                            |
| `GIT_WATCH_DIR`        | `/app/watched-repo`    | The directory inside the container to watch for changes. This must match the container path you set in the `volumes` section.           |

**4. Running gitwatch:**

- **Start the container** in the background (detached mode):

  ```sh
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- **View the logs** to see what `gitwatch` is doing:

  ```sh
  docker-compose logs -f
  ```

- **Stop the container**:

  ```sh
  docker-compose down
  ```

### Using the Dockerfile

If you prefer to build the Docker image yourself, you can use the provided
`Dockerfile`. This is useful if you want to customize the image with additional
tools or dependencies.

**1. Build the image:**

From the root of the `gitwatch` repository, run:

```sh
docker build -t gitwatch .
```

**2. Run the container:**

To run the container, you need to provide the same volumes and environment
variables as the Docker Compose setup.

```sh
docker run -d \
    --name gitwatch \
    -v /path/to/your/repo:/app/watched-repo \
    -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa:ro \
    -v ~/.gitconfig:/root/.gitconfig:ro \
    -e GIT_WATCH_DIR="/app/watched-repo" \
    -e GIT_REMOTE="origin" \
    -e GIT_BRANCH="main" \
    gitwatch
```

**Important:** Remember to replace `/path/to/your/repo` with the actual path to
the Git repository you want to watch.

## Requirements

To run this script, you must have installed and globally available:

- **Git:** ([Git](https://github.com/git/git) |
  [git-scm](http://www.git-scm.com))
- **File Watcher:** Either `inotifywait` (part of
  **[inotify-tools](https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools)**, for Linux) or
  `fswatch` (for macOS/BSD).
- **Locking:** `flock` (part of `util-linux` on most Linux distributions). This
  is required for process locking unless explicitly disabled with the `-n` flag.
- **Timeout:** `timeout` (part of `coreutils` on most Linux/macOS distributions)
  for robust Git operations.
- **Debouncing:** `pkill` (part of `procps` on Linux or `proctools` on macOS)
  for robustly managing debounce timers.
- **Hashing (Recommended):** `sha256sum` or `md5sum` (part of `coreutils`).
  These are strongly recommended for generating clean, unique lockfile names. If
  they are not found, `gitwatch` will still run but will fall back to using a
  less-ideal lockfile name based on the full repository path.

The script automatically detects the appropriate watcher tool based on your
operating system.

## Local Testing

This project uses [BATS](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) for testing.
The easiest way to run the full test suite is by using the provided `Makefile`.

1. **Install Dependencies**: Follow the instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` to
   install the runtime and testing dependencies (like `bats-core`, `shellcheck`,
   etc.).

2. **Install Hooks**: Install the `pre-commit` hooks, which will ensure all
   linting passes before you commit.

   ```sh
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Run Tests**:

   ```sh
   make test
   ```

## What it does

When you start the script, it first performs critical checks:

1. **Permission Check:** Verifies the user has read/write/execute permissions on
   the target directory and the `.git` directory.
2. **Locking Check:** Attempts to acquire a non-blocking process lock using
   `flock` to prevent multiple instances from running concurrently on the same
   repository.
3. **Optional Startup Commit:** If the `-f` flag is provided, it commits any
   pending staged changes before starting the watch loop.

Then it enters the main loop, which runs forever (until forcefully
stopped/killed), where it:

- **Watches for changes** using `inotifywait` (Linux) or `fswatch` (macOS),
  which block until an event occurs.
- **Debounces changes** for the configured `SLEEP_TIME` (default 2 seconds). The
  advanced debounce logic is PID-file-based and kills outdated commit timers
  when new changes arrive, ensuring only one commit runs for a rapid burst of
  changes.
- **Stages changes:**
  - Case file: `git add <file>`
  - Case directory: `git add --all .`
- **Avoids empty commits:** It compares the staged file tree with the HEAD file
  tree. If only metadata (like file timestamps) has changed, the commit is
  skipped, and any spurious index entries are unstaged with `git reset --mixed`.
- **Commits changes:** `git commit -m "Scripted auto-commit on change (<date>)"`
- **Optional Pull/Push:** If a remote is defined (`-r`):
  - If `-R` is used, it runs `git pull --rebase <remote>` before pushing.
  - It then pushes to the configured remote/branch (`-b`).

Notes:

- The debouncing mechanism handles rapid, consecutive changes robustly, ensuring
  one successful commit per burst.
- `gitwatch` includes graceful shutdown handling (`INT`, `TERM`) and automatic
  cleanup of lockfiles and timer PIDs via `trap`.
- Repositories are always watched recursively by default when a directory is the
  target.

## Usage

The general usage syntax is:

```sh
gitwatch.sh [-s <secs>] [-t <secs>] [-d <fmt>] [-r <remote> [-b <branch> | -R]] \
    [-g <path>] [-m <msg>] [-l | -L <lines>] [-x <pattern>] [-X <glob/list>] \
    [-c <command> [-C]] [-M] [-S] [-v] [-f] [-V] <target>

### Security Considerations

**Arbitrary Code Execution via `-c`**

The `-c` (custom command) flag is a powerful feature that executes arbitrary
shell commands. This is by design, but it carries inherent security risks,
especially if `gitwatch` is run as a privileged user or in an environment where
the repository content (which could be pulled from a remote) is not fully
trusted.

**Warning:** Only use the `-c` flag with trusted commands. Never run `gitwatch`
as root if watching a repository that could be modified by untrusted users.

### Behavior Notes

- **Repository Requirement:** The watched file or directory must already be part
  of a Git repository.
- **Automatic Staging:** For a file target, only the file is staged
  (`` `git add <file>` ``). For a directory target, all changes (adds,
  modifications, deletions) in the directory are staged recursively
  (`` `git add --all .` ``).
- **Empty Commit Prevention:** `gitwatch` prevents commits if only metadata
  (like timestamps) has changed, ensuring only meaningful file content or file
  count changes result in a new commit.
- **Large File Safety Gate:** `gitwatch` includes a safety check (on directory
  watches) that prevents commits if an untracked file larger than 50MB is
  detected. This avoids accidentally committing large binary files or archives.
- **Symlink Behavior:** `gitwatch` does not follow symlinks. On Linux
  (`inotifywait`) this is the default, and on macOS (`fswatch`) the `-X` flag is
  used to ensure symlinks pointing outside the watched directory are ignored.

### Advanced Environment Variables (non-Docker)

For advanced use cases (e.g., running from source or via systemd), you can
override default script behavior using environment variables:

- `GW_GIT_BIN`: Specify the full path to the `git` binary.
- `GW_INW_BIN`: Specify the full path to the watcher binary (`inotifywait` or
  `fswatch`).
- `GW_FLOCK_BIN`: Specify the full path to the `flock` binary.
- `GW_TIMEOUT_BIN`: Specify the full path to the `timeout` binary (e.g.,
  `gtimeout` on macOS).
- `GW_TIMEOUT`: Overrides the default 60-second timeout for Git operations.
- `GW_READ_TIMEOUT`: Overrides the auto-detected event drain timeout (e.g.,
  `0.1` or `1`).
- `GW_LOG_LINE_LENGTH`: Overrides the default 150-character truncation for
  _individual lines_ in the `-l`/`-L` commit log. Does not affect the number of
  lines.

### Starting on Boot

If you want to have the script auto-started upon boot, the method to do this
depends on your operating system and distribution.

Please also note that if either of the paths involved (script or target)
contains spaces or special characters, you need to escape them accordingly.

#### SysVInit

A central place to put startup scripts on Linux is generally `/etc/rc.local`.
This file, if it has the +x bit, will be executed upon startup, **by the root
user account**. If you want to start `gitwatch` from `rc.local`, the recommended
way to call it is:

```shell
su -c "/absolute/path/to/script/gitwatch.sh /absolute/path/to/watched/file/or/folder" -l <username> &
```

The `<username>` bit should be replaced with your username or that of any other
(non-root) user account; it only needs write-access to the Git repository of the
file/folder you want to watch. The ampersand (`&`) at the end sends the launched
process into the background (this is important if you have other calls in
`rc.local` after the mentioned line, because the `gitwatch` call does not
usually return).

#### systemd

This service is designed to run in user space (`--user` flag).

- If installed to a path other than `/usr/local/bin/gitwatch`, modify the
  `ExecStart` path within `examples/gitwatch@.service` to suit.

- Create the user systemd directory if it does not exist and copy the systemd
  service file:
  `mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/systemd/user" && cp examples/gitwatch@.service $HOME/.config/systemd/user`

- Start and enable the service for a given path and arguments by running the
  following command. The arguments are passed to the service after being
  escaped.

  ```shell
  systemctl --user --now enable gitwatch@$(systemd-escape -- "'-r url/to/repository' /path/to/folder").service
  ```

  **Note on persistence:** By default, `systemd` user services are terminated
  when the user logs out. To ensure `gitwatch` runs even when you are not logged
  in, you must enable "lingering" for your user:

  ```shell
  loginctl enable-linger <your-username>
  ```

### Troubleshooting / FAQ

**Q: My logs show "ERROR: 'git push' failed." and mention "non-fast-forward".
What do I do?**

**A:** This means the remote repository (e.g., `origin`) has changes that your
local repository does not have. `gitwatch` will not overwrite these changes. To
fix this:

1. Stop `gitwatch`.
2. In your watched repository, run `git pull --rebase` to fetch and apply the
   remote changes.
3. Resolve any merge conflicts that may occur.
4. Restart `gitwatch`.

To have `gitwatch` attempt this for you automatically, run it with the **`-R`**
flag.

**Q: My logs show "CRITICAL PERMISSION ERROR: Cannot Access Target Directory".**

**A:** This means the user running `gitwatch` does not have Read, Write, and
Execute permissions on the directory it's trying to watch.

- **On Linux/macOS:** Ensure you own the directory. Run
  `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/your/repo`.
- **In Docker:** This is a common problem. You **must** set the `PUID` and
  `PGID` environment variables in your `docker-compose.yaml` to match your host
  user's ID. You can find these by running `id -u` and `id -g` on your host
  machine.

**Q: Can I run multiple `gitwatch` scripts on the same repository?**

**A:** Yes. As of version 0.6+, `gitwatch` creates a unique lockfile based on a
hash of the _target path_ you are watching. This allows you to run multiple
instances on the same repository, as long as they are watching different files
or sub-directories (e.g., one for `/repo/docs` and one for `/repo/src`).

**Q: My Docker container is "unhealthy". Is it broken?**

**A:** Not necessarily. `gitwatch` has an advanced health check. If the
container is "unhealthy," it can mean one of two things:

1. The script has crashed (check logs with `docker-compose logs -f`).
2. The script has entered its automatic "cool-down" period after repeated
   failures (e.g., it couldn't reach your Git remote). This is normal behavior
   to prevent spamming. The script will be marked "healthy" again and resume
   operations after the cool-down period (default: 10 minutes) expires.

**Q: Will `gitwatch` make a new commit if I just `touch` a file?**

**A:** No, `gitwatch` compares file content hashes before committing. It will
ignore changes that only affect file timestamps or metadata, preventing empty
commits.

**Q: What happens if `gitwatch` tries to push but my remote is ahead
(non-fast-forward)?**

**A:** `gitwatch` will log an error and skip the push. It will not overwrite
remote changes. To fix this, you must manually resolve the divergence (e.g.,
`git pull --rebase`). To have `gitwatch` attempt this for you automatically, run
it with the **`-R`** flag.

**Q: What happens if my `pre-commit` or `pre-push` hook fails?**

**A:** `gitwatch` will gracefully handle the failure. It will log the error
message from the hook and skip the commit or push. The script will continue
running and will retry on the next file change.

**Q: Can I run multiple `gitwatch` scripts on the same repository?**

**A:** Yes, as long as they are watching _different target paths_. `gitwatch`
creates a unique lockfile for each path it watches, so you can safely watch
`/repo/docs` and `/repo/src` with separate processes.

**Q: What happens if I use the `-R` (rebase) flag and a merge conflict occurs?**

**A:** `gitwatch` will gracefully handle the error. It will log the failure from
`git pull --rebase`, skip the push, and then **stop**. This is by design. It
leaves the repository in a conflicted state (e.g., `git status` will show
unmerged paths) so that you can manually resolve the conflict. Once you have
resolved the conflict and finished the rebase (e.g., `git rebase --continue`),
you must restart `gitwatch`.
